# KeyboardLayout

This repository contains the sources of the MadTic keyboard layout for Windows.
It is based on the QWERTY International keyboard but with the dead keys migrated to Ctrl+Alt (AltGr) + the original dead key.
AltGr can also be used to get shortcuts to the most used forms (é,ê,è are all found near the e key with the AltGr modificator)

You will have to instal MKLC (Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator) to create the keyboard DLL with the .klc file.
The 1.4 version was used to create these sources.
After installation of the DLL, you will need a reboot to find the new keyboard layout.
